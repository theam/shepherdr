Native macOS console for herding your coding agents across your Herdr machines: one prioritized queue, the real terminal of every session, a browser per session, and a notification when it's your turn.

### What's new in 0.8.3

- **Start a new project from New Session.** When the folder doesn't exist, New Session offers to make it a new project: **NEW PROJECT** creates the folder, runs `git init` in it and opens the session, on this Mac or on any of your machines.

### Fixed

- New sessions on other machines opened in the home folder when their folder was missing or started with `~`. Shepherdr now checks the folder over SSH first, where `~` means that machine's home.

### Download and install

- **Apple Silicon (M1 or later), macOS 14 Sonoma or later.** Xcode is not required.
- Download **Shepherdr-…-macos-arm64.dmg**, open it, and drag **Shepherdr.app** to **Applications**. A ZIP of the same app is also available.
- **Required:** install and start [Herdr](https://herdr.dev/docs/) separately. Remote machines use Herdr's saved machine profiles and a CLI with `--machine` support, such as 0.9.3.
- **Recommended:** the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com), signed in with `gh auth login`, to confirm pull requests and issues, fetch their titles and watch pull requests' CI checks.
- Terminals require `terminal session observe/control` on the target machine (verified with CLI/server 0.9.3). Remote terminals, folder checks, machine load and commands left running use an already-trusted SSH host and noninteractive authentication on Unix-like hosts.
- Shepherdr is **signed with The Agile Monkeys' Developer ID and notarized by Apple**: it opens like any other download, with no trip to **Privacy & Security**.
- macOS asks for permission the first time Shepherdr notifies you or you dictate. Dictation downloads its speech model (about 460 MB) from Hugging Face once, after asking.
- `SHA256SUMS` contains checksums for both downloads. In their download directory, run `shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS` after downloading both packages.

Shepherdr is an independent client for Herdr. It creates, renames or closes sessions and changes machines only when you ask; input goes only to the unlocked session you are viewing, and never replaces another client's input without an explicit Take Over.
